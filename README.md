## Record and Replay

This project aims to record and replay wideband/multi band signals using the [Ettus Research USRP X300/X310](https://kb.ettus.com/X300/X310_Getting_Started_Guides) SDR platform.

The scripts are generated with [GnuRadio](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/USRP_Source).
The USRP is populated with two [UBX160 front-end](https://www.ettus.com/all-products/ubx160/).

The software is provided as it is.
